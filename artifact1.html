  <h1>Eco-Coach Chatbot Project</h1>
  <p>
    The Eco-Coach Chatbot is an AI-powered interactive assistant designed to promote eco-friendly habits by providing real-time guidance and personalized suggestions. This project integrates natural language processing (NLP) techniques with modern web technologies to create an engaging user experience that motivates sustainable lifestyle choices.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Overview and Objectives</h2>
  <div class="section-box">
    <p>
      The goal of this project was to build a conversational AI tool capable of understanding user queries about environmental topics and responding with helpful tips and resources. It serves as both an educational tool and a behavioral coach to encourage sustainable actions in daily life.
    </p>
    <p>
      We aimed to combine machine learning models, rule-based logic, and a responsive user interface to achieve a seamless experience that could be easily extended in future iterations.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Development Process</h2>
  <div class="section-box">
    <p>
      The chatbot backend was built using Python’s Flask framework and leverages NLP libraries such as spaCy for intent recognition and NLTK for text processing. Machine learning classifiers were trained on labeled datasets of environmental questions and user intents to provide accurate responses.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the frontend, a React-based interface ensures responsive and dynamic conversations, with real-time feedback and user-friendly design principles.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Technologies and Tools Used</h2>
  <div class="section-box">
    <ul>
      <li>Python, Flask (Backend API)</li>
      <li>spaCy, NLTK (Natural Language Processing)</li>
      <li>React.js (Frontend UI)</li>
      <li>Heroku (Deployment)</li>
      <li>GitHub for version control and collaboration</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <div class="section-box">
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time conversational interaction with natural language understanding</li>
      <li>Personalized eco-friendly suggestions based on user inputs</li>
      <li>Interactive FAQs on environmental topics</li>
      <li>Easy integration with external APIs for updated information</li>
      <li>Responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Reflection and Lessons Learned</h2>
  <div class="section-box">
    <p>
      This project deepened my understanding of NLP techniques and how supervised learning models can be trained to classify user intents effectively. Working on integrating multiple technologies enhanced my skills in full-stack development and taught me the importance of clean data and iterative testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Challenges included managing ambiguous user inputs and improving the chatbot’s ability to handle unexpected questions, which was addressed by expanding training data and refining the intent classification model.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Personal Contribution</h2>
  <div class="section-box">
    <p>
      I led the design and implementation of the backend chatbot logic, including data preprocessing, model training, and API development. Additionally, I contributed to the frontend interface design to ensure seamless user experience across devices.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
  <div class="section-box">
    <p>
      Moving forward, I plan to incorporate reinforcement learning to allow the chatbot to improve its responses based on user feedback dynamically. Integrating voice recognition and multilingual support are also priorities to broaden accessibility.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Connection to Machine Learning Training Methods</h2>
  <div class="section-box">
    <p>
      The Eco-Coach Chatbot project exemplifies supervised learning, where labeled training data was essential for teaching the model to recognize user intents accurately. The iterative training and testing cycles reflect key machine learning principles, emphasizing the importance of quality data and repeated exposure for model refinement.
