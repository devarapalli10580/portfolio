    <h3>Challenges Faced and Solutions</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Natural Language Understanding</dt>
      <dd>
        Ensuring the chatbot correctly interprets diverse user inputs was complex. This was addressed by extensive training data and continuous tuning of intent classifiers.
      </dd>

      <dt>Maintaining Engagement</dt>
      <dd>
        Initial chatbot interactions were somewhat static, so gamification strategies like progress tracking and rewards were added to increase motivation.
      </dd>

      <dt>Scalability</dt>
      <dd>
        Managing concurrent users while maintaining performance required optimizing backend services and leveraging Azure’s scalable infrastructure.
