    <h3>Background and Context</h3>
    <p>
      As part of my AIML-500 course, I engaged with SchoolAI’s Training Methods Coach to explore foundational machine learning topics such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. This conversational AI offered personalized guidance, helping me clarify concepts, ask deeper questions, and connect theory with practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platform provided a safe, supportive environment to experiment with ideas, receive instant feedback, and reflect on learning progress without the pressure of traditional classroom settings.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="artifact-section">
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To strengthen conceptual understanding of diverse machine learning training methods</li>
      <li>To practice inquiry-based learning through interaction with an AI chatbot</li>
      <li>To develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills related to AI and data science</li>
      <li>To document the learning journey and reflect on insights gained</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="artifact-section">
    <h3>Learning Experience and Interaction Overview</h3>
    <p>
      My engagement consisted of a series of structured dialogues where I asked key questions such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How do supervised learning models learn from labeled data?</li>
      <li>What differentiates unsupervised learning training approaches?</li>
      <li>How does reinforcement learning optimize decision-making?</li>
      <li>Why are algorithms critical for model training?</li>
      <li>What is the significance of iterative training and data quality?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The chatbot responded with clear, concise explanations and prompted me to think critically by posing reflective questions. This iterative exchange allowed me to deepen my understanding while maintaining a collaborative tone.

    <h3>Key Insights and Concepts Learned</h3>
    <article>
      <h4>Supervised Learning</h4>
      <p>
        Models learn patterns by mapping input data to labeled outputs, adjusting predictions iteratively based on error feedback to improve accuracy.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h4>Unsupervised Learning</h4>
      <p>
        Algorithms identify inherent structures in unlabeled data by clustering, dimensionality reduction, or anomaly detection without explicit targets.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h4>Reinforcement Learning</h4>
      <p>
        Agents learn optimal behaviors by balancing exploration of new actions and exploitation of known rewards, guided by reward functions designed to achieve goals.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h4>Training Algorithms and Optimization</h4>
      <p>
        Optimization techniques such as gradient descent adjust model parameters efficiently to minimize loss functions, with learning rates controlling update magnitudes.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h4>Importance of Data Quality and Repetition</h4>
      <p>
        Training models on high-quality, representative data through multiple epochs ensures robust pattern recognition and generalization to unseen data.
      </p>
    </article>

    <h3>Reflection on AI-Assisted Learning</h3>
    <p>
      Using the SchoolAI chatbot offered a unique blend of flexibility and guidance, enabling me to tailor my learning path while benefiting from instant expert-level explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversational format encouraged curiosity, iterative questioning, and active problem-solving, which enhanced my engagement and retention of complex concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also highlighted the potential of AI tools as valuable educational assistants in higher education and professional development.

    <h3>Challenges and How I Overcame Them</h3>
    <p>
      Initially, some technical jargon and algorithmic details were challenging to grasp fully. To address this, I utilized the chatbot’s ability to simplify explanations and asked for concrete examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also supplemented the chatbot interactions with independent research, using recommended academic papers and trusted web sources to validate and deepen my knowledge.
