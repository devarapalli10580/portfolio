    <h3>Timeline Highlights</h3>
    <article>
      <h4>1950s: The Dawn of AI</h4>
      <p>
        Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," proposing the famous Turing Test as a measure of machine intelligence. The term “Artificial Intelligence” is coined at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h4>1960s-1970s: Early AI Systems</h4>
      <p>
        Early rule-based systems and symbolic AI emerge. Programs like ELIZA simulate human conversation. The first neural networks are developed but remain limited due to computing power.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h4>1980s: Expert Systems & AI Winter</h4>
      <p>
        Expert systems gain traction in industry, automating decision-making. However, AI suffers from "winters" due to unmet expectations and funding cuts.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h4>1990s: Machine Learning Foundations</h4>
      <p>
        Shift from rule-based AI to statistical learning. Algorithms such as support vector machines and decision trees gain prominence. IBM's Deep Blue defeats chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h4>2000s: Big Data and Deep Learning</h4>
      <p>
        The rise of big data and GPUs enables deep neural networks. Breakthroughs in image and speech recognition emerge. AI starts penetrating real-world applications.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h4>2010s-Present: AI Everywhere</h4>
      <p>
        AI integrates into daily life — from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to autonomous vehicles. Advances in reinforcement learning and generative models expand capabilities.

    <h3>Design and Development Process</h3>
    <p>
      The timeline was created using PowerPoint with enhanced visual elements and interactive components. Key steps included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Researching and verifying historical facts and milestones</li>
      <li>Organizing information chronologically for clarity</li>
      <li>Designing visual aids such as icons, graphs, and images</li>
      <li>Adding detailed notes and context to each timeline point</li>
      <li>Ensuring accessibility and readability for diverse audiences</li>
    </ul>
